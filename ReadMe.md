We can say that most people in the world have played the snake game at least once 🤩

In this project, I wanted to make you feel nostalgic for this game, but with a big difference 😲

But what is the difference 🤔

## Process

The process of this game is similar to our snake game, but instead of playing the role of a snake, you play the role of an apple (food) 🤣🍎

In this game, a strong AI is used, which is as follows:

The game snake follows you as an apple and you have to escape from the snake, but note that the speed of the snake depends on the speed of your movement 😄

In this game you can move the apple or food using the right, left, up and down keys 😉

You should not hit the snake's head, because if you hit the snake's head, it mean you have lost 😑
